# 🛡️ Tallal Bashir – Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. I'm currently pursuing the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** and building hands-on experience in **log analysis**, **incident response**, **SIEM tools**, and **threat detection**. This portfolio showcases practical projects and investigations that reflect my learning journey and capabilities in defensive security.
